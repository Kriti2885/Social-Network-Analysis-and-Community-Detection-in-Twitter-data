### Introduction

  Social network analysis[SNA] is a process to identify and understand the underlying relationship between different players in a social network. SNA help in understanding the flow of information in so- cial media. The SNA graphical representation is made up of nodes and links between nodes. The nodes in the network represent the people and the links between the nodes represent the information flow.
  
  Community detection in social network is to identify nodes with higher similarity and clustering them together. The essence here is that nodes of the same community are highly similar while on contrary, nodes across communities present low similarity. Community detection and social network analysis are now used in various fields like:

a) Neuroscience: Analyzing directed brain networks produced by neuron interactions, neuroscien- tists are able to comprehend the functional architecture of the brain
b) Biology: In prokaryote genome sequence data, the donor-recipient relations among genomes are modeled by directed networks (called Lateral Gene Transfer networks - LGT).

  In this project, I tried to find answer to the following questions:
  
    a) To analyze the social network and understand how information flows in a network. 
    
    b) To find the community structure, if  exists, in a social network.
    
    c) If there is any change in the structure of community over different periods of time.
